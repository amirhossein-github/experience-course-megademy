## About Project : Section '/easy-trade/'

### Code-Sketch
**V1**: I spent time and designed the code-sketch of this section. It was very hard but it will be worth it.

**V2**: During the implementation of the code-sketch, I realized that some changes were necessary, so I applied the changes and put the new version in the V2 directory and also the previous version in the new V1 directory. In these changes, added 'containers' in each section , and in the 'section#description' of the ul li structure.

**V3**: During the implementation of the code-sketch, that is, I did not correct the place of input tags, and I corrected them in this update.
