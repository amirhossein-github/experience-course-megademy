## About Project : Section '/easy-trade/'

### Code-Sketch
- I spent time and designed the code-sketch of this section. It was very hard but it will be worth it. [[Link](https://github.com/amirhossein-github/teacher-khateri/tree/main/side-projects/sampleSite(hamtapay.net)/hamtapay.net/easy-trade/code-sketch/v1/easy-trade.png)] - `1403,05,06 2024,07,27`
- During the implementation of the code-sketch, I realized that some changes were necessary, so I applied the changes and put the new version in the V2 directory and also the previous version in the new V1 directory. In these changes, added 'containers' in each section , and in the 'section#description' of the ul li structure.
