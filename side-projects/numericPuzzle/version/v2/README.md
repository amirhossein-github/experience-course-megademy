**Date**: 1403,05,14- 2024,08,04
**Description**: In this version, I started from the beginning and designed the two-number mode of this puzzle, that is: **`X1 (Math Operation) X2`**.

- ðŸŸ¢ This version supports the following math operations:
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Power
    - Root
    - Sine
    - Cosine
    - Factorial

- ðŸ”´ The output of the program is very large and makes it difficult to read.
- ðŸ”´ It has not been fully tested and may have calculation errors in certain cases.
