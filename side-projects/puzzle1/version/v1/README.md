**Description**: To solve this puzzle, you have to put 3 numbers 9 between the mathematical operators so that the final answer is one.<br>
This project was supposed to be solved manually and like a simple puzzle, although some friends used artificial intelligence to solve the challenge, but it occurred to me to solve this puzzle by using a programming language, whether Python or JavaScript.
```js
9 _ 9 _ 9 = 1 // How?
```
## Answer

#### Some seemingly correct but wrong answers
```js
1. ( 9 - 9 ) ** 9
2. ( 9 ** ( 1 / 2 )) * ( 9 ** ( 1 / 2 )) / 9
3. 9 && 9 / 9
4. ( 9 ** 0 ) * 9 / 9

// Correct answers
5. 9 ** 9 - 9
6. (9 / 9) 9
```
