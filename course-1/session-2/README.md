### A Few Reminders
- The teacher pointed to the "**pyramid of learning[^1]**" and said that you should try to teach others what you know.
- It is very important to **take notes** during the course.
- Referring to the "Documentation" of the project. I don't know much about it. I need to do more research.
- Mentioning that Mr. Heydari's "**[SilverBox](https://github.com/Silverethical/silverBox)**" project has been added to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). But I did not find anything.
- Use **[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)** instead of **[w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/)** for this course and next courses.

### Github and VS-Code
- The **exercises** that you are told should be placed on Github in a regular and correct manner and  USB-Flash, phone, WhatsApp, etc. should not be used.
- To use Github, it is necessary to use several software. 1. **[GitHub Desktop](https://www.gitkraken.com/download?_gl=1*mfwdlk*_up*MQ..&gclid=Cj0KCQjwv7O0BhDwARIsAC0sjWP_b_ZWM-w-R6wvdos2PJtMGWpEurfWY2b23nAtYxBkiPjvW2R4P3oaAgiiEALw_wcB)** 2. **[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**

    6. Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", use the branch dropdown menu and select a publishing source. (main)
    7. In your repository, in the About section, click on the gear.
    8. Tick "Use your GitHub Pages website" to enable it.

### Javascript
- How to add javascript code in html file.<br>
As in the past, style was added to the html file using the style tag, now we add JavaScript codes to the file using the script tag.
```html
 <script> 
    alert("Hello World!")
</script>
```
> [!TIP]
> JavaScript codes are normally better placed in the last part of the code because the HTML elements should be first so that we can apply changes to them.
