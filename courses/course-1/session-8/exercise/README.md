## About Exercise
1. Why in the [class exercise](https://github.com/amirhossein-github/teacher-khateri/blob/main/courses/course-1/session-8/README.md#number-three) among the logical operators that the output answer should be `true` or `false`, we got the answer `-1`.
2. Research about String methods?
    - length
    - concat
    - uppercase
    - lowercase
    - indexOf
    - includes
    - substring
    - slice
    - split
    - replace
    - repeat
3. Perform four basic mathematical operations (`*`, `/`, `+`, `-`) on two variables `num1` and `num2` and show them with the `console.log`.
```js
// Calculator
let calc = 0, num1 = 0, num2 = 0
// Your code
console.log(calc);
```
4. Suppose we have stored a text in a variable named `string` and we have a text in another variable named `target`.
Our goal is to write a script that tells us if the `target` value is present in the `string`.
```js
// Search
let string = '... Every Thing ...', target = 'Something'
// Your code
console.log(string)
```
