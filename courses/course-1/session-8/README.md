## Algorithm

### Example
**Question**: Find the biggest index of an array.
1. Start
2. Put a variable with the name `biggestIndex` in memory.
3. Set the `biggestIndex` equal to the first index.
4. We compare the array items one by one with the first index(`biggestIndex`).
5. If the `biggestIndex` variable is greater than the compared index, continue.
6. If the `biggestIndex` variable is smaller than the compared index, it will be replaced.
7. Continue this process until the end of the array.
8. display `biggestIndex` variable.
9. End
