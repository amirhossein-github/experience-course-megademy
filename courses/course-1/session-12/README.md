## Git Commit: Tip & Trick
**What should be mentioned in the commit?**
- What code did we type?
- Why did we enter this code?

**The commit header must be in command form:**
- True: add something
- False: added something

**MD Syntax:**
- You can use MD syntax to write commits.

**Docs:**
- To send Markdown files
- For comments

**Use Change Log:**
- Syntax: [fileName][subjec]: description
- e.g.: [silverBox][Removed]: Remove uniqueNumber helper function

**Issues and Pull Request:**
- Pull Request: Reviewing other people's project and improving it and submitting it to their repository.
- Issues: Finding a bug in an open source project and specifying the bug with a description.

## Experience
- By the end of the day, the entered codes must be committed and then pushed.
- In each section and exercise, use the flowchart, algorithm, and sketch code to draw a road map.
- For debugging, when you encounter a bug, especially if you have been involved in the code for long hours, take a break and then go to fix the bug.
